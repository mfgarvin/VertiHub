A clock built for a strand of Adafruit Neopixel LED lights, running on a Raspberry Pi. Weather and other notifications are built into it as well.
With the exception of the WUnderground integration, this likely still works (with the right hardware and proper wiring), though it's been unused / untested for years now.
Archived for posterity's sake.
